# Simple blog with comments 

Learning points 
- Rails is constantly becoming out of date - a resource from three, four, five years ago will be no help, and the way the code is written will constantly be changing- but with not great documentation 
- link_to is about post so might get annoyed, use button_to instead for delete/destroy 
- learnt about migrate - making changes to a schema in a database 
- learnt that rails has a lot of smart inbuilt methods which can be very helpful 
- worked more with classes, and have a better understanding of controllers, views and models (models are great for establishing relationships)
